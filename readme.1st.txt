Thankyou for downloading Cypto 1.0!

Crypto 1.0 is an encryption program that
uses public and private keys. The concept
of public and private keys goes as follows:

1. You generate a public and private keypair.

2. You distrubute your public key (keyname.pbk)
   to people who would want to send secure documents
   to you.

3. Say a person wants to send a letter to you
   a they don't want anyone else to read it, they
   would import your public key and encrypt the
   letter. They would then send the encrypted letter
   to you. You would import your private key, enter
   your password and decrypt the letter.

4. The same applies if you want to send an encrypted 
   letter to someone. You would import their public
   key, encrypt the letter and send it off to them.

Cypto 1.0 does all of the above and also includes
the feature of securely destroying files. In Windows,
when you send a file to the Recycle Bin and empty the
Recycle Bin, your file is still there. All Windows does
is delete the reference to the file, not the actual file
itself. Crypto overwrites the file many times and then
removes the file and it's reference.

Included is a sample public key and a document encrypted
using the public key.

Have fun!
